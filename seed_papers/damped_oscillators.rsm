The damped harmonic oscillator extends the simple harmonic oscillator by incorporating
energy dissipation. This paper examines the three characteristic regimes—underdamped,
critically damped, and overdamped—and demonstrates how the damping coefficient
fundamentally determines system behavior. An interactive simulation enables exploration
of parameter space, building intuition for this fundamental physical system.

## Equation of Motion

Consider a mass $m$ on a spring (constant $k$) subject to damping proportional to velocity:
$$
m\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = -kx - b\frac{dx}{dt}
$$

Rearranging with $\omega_0 = \sqrt{k/m}$ and $\gamma = b/(2m)$,
$$
\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + 2\gamma\frac{dx}{dt} + \omega_0^2 x = 0
$$

The general solution depends on the discriminant $\gamma^2 - \omega_0^2$,
$$
x(t) = A e^{-\gamma t} \cos(\omega_d t + \phi) \quad \text{(underdamped, } \gamma < \omega_0\text{)}
$$

$$
x(t) = (A + Bt)e^{-\gamma t} \quad \text{(critically damped, } \gamma = \omega_0\text{)}
$$

$$
x(t) = A_1 e^{r_1 t} + A_2 e^{r_2 t} \quad \text{(overdamped, } \gamma > \omega_0\text{)},
$$
where $\omega_d = \sqrt{\omega_0^2 - \gamma^2}$ is the damped frequency and $r_{1,2}$ are negative real roots.

## Three Damping Regimes

The underdamped regime (${:label:under, :types: hl}\gamma < \omega_0$) produces
oscillations with exponentially decaying amplitude $Ae^{-\gamma t}$. Energy decays as
$E(t) \propto e^{-2\gamma t}$. This behavior is common in mechanical systems where
oscillation before settling is acceptable.

Critical damping (${:label:crit, :types: hl}\gamma = \omega_0$) represents the boundary
case, returning to equilibrium in minimum time without overshooting. This regime is
optimal for shock absorbers and door closers.

The overdamped regime (${:label:over, :types: hl}\gamma > \omega_0$) causes the system
to slowly creep to equilibrium without oscillating. Return is slower than critical
damping. This behavior is common in highly viscous environments.

## Interactive Simulation

The visualization below demonstrates all three regimes. Adjustable parameters include
the natural frequency $\omega_0$ (oscillation rate without damping), damping coefficient
$\gamma$ (energy dissipation strength), and initial conditions $x_0$ and $v_0$ (starting
position and velocity). Watch the system transition from :ref:under,underdamped::
(oscillatory) through :ref:crit, critically damped:: (optimal) to :ref:over,overdamped::
(slow decay) as $\gamma$ increases past $\omega_0$. The simulation shows position vs.
time with exponential envelope (underdamped case) and phase space trajectories
converging to the origin.

## Applications

In mechanical engineering, shock absorbers are designed as underdamped ($\zeta \approx
0.3-0.4$) to allow one oscillation after impact, providing comfort while maintaining
tire contact. Buildings use underdamped dampers and tuned mass dampers for seismic
protection, dissipating earthquake energy.

RLC circuits provide an electrical analog where inductance $L \leftrightarrow m$,
capacitance $C \leftrightarrow 1/k$, and resistance $R \leftrightarrow b$. Door closers
are designed as critically or slightly overdamped to close smoothly without bouncing.

## Conclusion

The damping coefficient $\gamma$ relative to natural frequency $\omega_0$ determines
qualitative behavior. :ref:crit,Critical:: damping provides fastest non-oscillatory
return, while :ref:under,underdamping:: and :ref:over,overdamping:: represent the
oscillatory and slow-decay regimes. Understanding these fundamental dynamics is
essential for applications from mechanical design to signal processing.
