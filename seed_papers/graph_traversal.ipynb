This paper examines the two fundamental approaches: Breadth-First Search—BFS—explores level-by-level, while Depth-First Search—DFS—explores as deep as possible before backtracking. Understanding their distinct characteristics is essential for selecting the appropriate algorithm for path-finding, connectivity analysis, and graph-based problem solving.\n",

    "A graph $G = (V, E)$ consists of vertices $V$ and edges $E$ connecting pairs of vertices. **Graph traversal** visits all vertices systematically—a fundamental operation with applications in navigation, network analysis, web crawling, and game AI.\n",

    "## Advanced Topics\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bidirectional Search\n",
    "\n",
    "For large graphs, **bidirectional BFS** can significantly improve performance by searching simultaneously from both start and target vertices until the frontiers meet.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time complexity improvement:** $O(b^{d/2} + b^{d/2}) = O(b^{d/2})$ compared to $O(b^d)$ for unidirectional BFS, where $b$ is the branching factor and $d$ is the distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Weighted Graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "For graphs with weighted edges, neither BFS nor DFS guarantees optimal paths. **Dijkstra's algorithm**—a weighted variant of BFS using a priority queue—or **A* search** are required.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "BFS and DFS represent fundamental graph traversal strategies with complementary strengths. BFS excels at finding shortest paths and works well for shallow, wide graphs, while DFS is memory-efficient for deep graphs and naturally supports cycle detection and topological sorting. Understanding when to apply each algorithm is essential for effective algorithm design.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key takeaway:** The choice between BFS and DFS depends on problem requirements (shortest path vs memory efficiency), graph structure (wide vs deep), and desired properties (completeness, cycle detection).\n",
