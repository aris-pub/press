    <p>Scroll Press is where modern research lives. We host HTML-native preprints that work beautifully on every device - from your phone on the train to your desktop in the lab.</p>

    <p>No more squinting at PDFs. No more pinch-to-zoom. Just research that respects your time and works everywhere.</p>

      <h2>Why HTML-native?</h2>
      <p>Traditional academic publishing relies on PDFsâ€”a format designed for print, not screens. HTML allows for responsive design, interactive elements, embedded media, and accessibility features that make research more engaging and inclusive.</p>

      <h2>Open and Transparent</h2>
      <p>All content on Scroll Press is freely accessible. We believe research should be open to everyone, from students to seasoned researchers, regardless of institutional affiliations or subscription access.</p>
