    <p>Scroll Press is where modern research lives. We host HTML-native preprints that work beautifully on every device - from your phone on the train to your desktop in the lab.</p>

    <p>No more squinting at PDFs. No more pinch-to-zoom. Just research that respects your time and works everywhere.</p>

      <h2>What is Press?</h2>
      <p>Press is a permanent preprint archive for HTML-native research. Think of it as what arXiv would be if it was built today - designed for the web, not for print.</p>

      <p>We host research papers written in HTML, issue DOIs through DataCite for permanent citability, and preserve your work with archival-grade infrastructure. Your interactive visualizations, embedded code, and responsive layouts aren't just supported - they're the point.</p>

      <h3>Why HTML-native?</h3>
      <p>Traditional academic publishing relies on PDFs—a format designed for print, not screens. HTML allows for responsive design, interactive elements, embedded media, and accessibility features that make research more engaging and inclusive.</p>

      <p>HTML research can adapt to any screen size, work with screen readers, and preserve interactive elements. Whether you write in Quarto, Typst, MyST, RSM Studio, or code HTML by hand, the web-native format gives your work the flexibility that PDFs can't provide.</p>

      <h2>What We ARE (and Aren't)</h2>
      <p>Press is intentionally focused. We're an archive, not a platform. Here's what that means:</p>

      <h3>We ARE:</h3>
      <p><strong>An HTML archive</strong> - We host HTML research permanently with immutable URLs and content integrity verification. Once published, your work stays exactly as you intended.</p>

      <p><strong>A DOI provider</strong> - Every paper receives a Digital Object Identifier through DataCite, making your work citable, discoverable, and part of the permanent scholarly record.</p>

      <p><strong>Tool-agnostic</strong> - We accept HTML from any source: Quarto, Typst, MyST, RSM Studio, Jupyter notebooks, or hand-coded HTML. Write in your tool of choice, export HTML, upload. We don't care how you made it.</p>

      <p><strong>Permanent storage</strong> - Content is immutable and versioned. What you publish today will be readable in the same form decades from now. We use content-addressable storage and maintain distributed backups.</p>

      <p><strong>Open source</strong> - The entire Press platform is open source and community-managed. No proprietary lock-in. You can inspect the code, contribute improvements, or fork the entire project if needed.</p>

      <h3>We are NOT:</h3>
      <p><strong>An authoring platform</strong> - We don't build editors or writing tools. Use Quarto, Typst, RSM Studio, Overleaf, Curvenote, or whatever tool suits your workflow. We archive the output.</p>

      <p><strong>A collaboration tool</strong> - We don't provide real-time editing or team workspaces. Use GitHub, Google Docs, or specialized research collaboration platforms for that. We host the final product.</p>

      <p><strong>A journal</strong> - We don't run peer review or editorial processes. We're a preprint server. Your work is published as-is, without gatekeeping.</p>

      <p><strong>A content management system</strong> - We're not a full CMS for managing research projects. We provide simple upload, permanent URLs, and archival guarantees. That's it.</p>

      <h3>We complement traditional archives</h3>
      <p>We complement traditional preprint archives such as arXiv, bioRxiv, and others. Our goal is for researchers to publish PDFs to traditional archives and HTML versions to Press when appropriate. arXiv excels at PDF archival with 30+ years of institutional trust. Press is designed for HTML archival with modern web infrastructure.</p>

      <h2>Who Runs This?</h2>
      <p><strong>The Aris Program</strong> - Press is part of <a href="https://aris.pub" class="page-link">The Aris Program</a>, a broader initiative building open-source infrastructure for post-PDF scientific publishing. The vision is community ownership - Press should outlive its founders and serve the research community for decades, not exit to an acquisition.</p>
